  Oh, won’t you help me Climb Up A Ladder
  Somebody tell me that this can be done
  Oh, won’t you help me Climb Up A Ladder
  Reach for the very next rung

  What can I do when I’m stuck in the middle
  Reach for the very next rung
  Feeling confused, like my life is a riddle
  Reach for the very next rung

  I can’t look up cause I’m scared where I’m going
  Reach for the very next rung
  Can’t look down, it’s a bad fear of falling
  Reach for the very next rung

  Well my hands are shaking
  My arms are aching
  My knees are quaking
  As I reach for the very next rung

  When the farmer comes to town with his wagon broken down
  The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all
  If you only look and see I think you will agree
  The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

  Well the lawyer hangs around while the butcher cuts a pound
  The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all
  While the preacher and the cook go strolling down the brook
  The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

  The Farmer Is The Man, The Farmer Is The Man
  Lives on credit till the fall
  His clothes are wearing thin, his condition it’s a sin
  The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

  Now the Farmer he left town and the place got broken down
  The pigweed and the thistle it was rife
  But the land in fallow lay, just waiting for the day
  When dreams and hands could bring it back to life

  Now the banker says he’s broke and the merchants up in smoke
  The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all
  It would put ‘em to the test if the farmer took a rest
  The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

  Schooldays Over come on then John
  Time you were getting those pit boots on
  On with the sark and the moleskin trowsers, time you were on your way
  Time you were learning the pit man’s job and earning a pit man’s pay

  Come on then Jim, time to go
  Time you were working on down below
  Time to be handling a pick and shovel it’s time you were on your way
  Time to be learning the colliers job and earning a colliers pay

  Come on then Dai, it’s almost light
  Time you were off for the anthracite
  The morning mist is on the valley, it’s time you were on your way
  Time you were learning a miners job and earning a miners pay

  Schooldays Over.

                <pre class="blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
  I’m just gliding through life on a tailwind
  I’m just drifting along with the breeze
  I have not a care, got my feet up in the air
  Laughing and floating with ease 
  I’m just gliding through life on a tailwind
  I’m just doing whatever I please
  Call me a clown, no you cannot hold me down
  I’m drifting along with the breeze

  No, do not worry friends, I am not crazy
  Soaring with my silvery balloons
  Apologies will never top nephrology
  Oh, look at me, I’m halfway to the moon

  I do not fear the stratosphere it’s heaven
  I’m swinging with angels in the clouds
  I hate that I’ll miss Jeopardy at seven
  But a lawn chair lets you sail above the crowds

                <pre class="blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
  We stepped out and turned right
  Straight into the morning light
  Silent rain fell at our feet
  And we walked down Empty Streets

  All the shops closed and still
  In the air the autumn chill
  Not a word could we speak
  As we walked down Empty Streets

  I still see your silken hair
  I feel you hold me tight
  Will you keep your promise dear
  Every day you’ll write 

  Five thousand miles from you dear
  Boredom laced with sudden fear
  And a soldier's life is bleak
  And he prays for Empty Streets

  Roads of hell, towns of dust
  As we stare down from these trucks
  Poor men fight while the rich men sleep
  And I dream of Empty Streets

                <pre class="blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
  Grandma's Old Piano she never let anyone play
  Sat silent in the corner, until they hauled it away
  Now I wonder, was it noise the old woman couldn’t stand
  Or did it bring back memories of some sweet lovers hands

  I know that she liked music, she always hummed a tune
  Magic in the kitchen By the Light of the Silvery Moon
  Moments that get lost in time can come to life again
  When music touches hidden thoughts buried deep within

  When Grandma wasn’t looking I’d sneak into that room
  Spin the chair up good and high and play myself a tune
  The low notes were the thunder, the high ones were the rain
  Holding down the pedals brought lightning to the plains

  Grandma's Old Piano she never let anyone play
  Sat silent in the corner, until they hauled it away
  No one will remember, nothing to regret 
  The storms of music I once made, times I can’t forget

  Don’t come to me for answers when this world gets you down 
  Me, I’m just a working man, got both feet on the ground 
  I measure out what’s needed in this life of mine 
  I focus on the details according to design

  Let’s talk of saws and hammers how to read the plans 
  My life is written in the scars you see on these old hands 
  And when you are rebuilding what storms have torn apart 
  Rock Bottom is a solid place to start

  You see me cutting lumber or driving survey stakes 
  I know just what I’m doing, I rarely make mistakes 
  That’s cause I made them years ago, way before your time 
  You bend some nails, break some bones before you reach your prime

  Don’t try to swing your hammer just the way I do 
  Find a rhythm all your own deep inside of you 
  When it’s time to build a house of your very own 
  There’s nothing wrong with starting out down on solid stone

  I left Frisco yesterday
  I had some good times with my friends
  I never let on that I knew
  That you and I were at the end
  ‘Cause I’ve learned too well to pretend
   
  I’m comin home to see you one more time
  Cause you’re the one who made me cry
  I’m comin home to see you one more time
  I’m comin’ home to say goodbye
   
  The mountains and the coast are clear
  I see the lights of Monterey
  Oh California my old friend
  Let’s not forget those early days
  Fore I may never pass this way
   
  ﻿Now I'm prepared to face the pain
  Of leavin' one I loved so true
  But we're just strangers once again
  And there ain't nothin' we can do
  So I'll just say goodbye to you

  Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight
  Watch out for the man   Washin’ pots and pans
  Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

  Rockin’ to and fro  Waltz across the floor
  Holding my baby so tight
  Doin’ what I can,    Like a Louisiana man
  Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

  Better pull the shade    as my knees begin to fade
  Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight
  Haven’t got a care    Prancin’ in my underwear
  Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

  Rockin’ to and fro  Waltz across the floor
  I got the bedroom in sight
  Doin’ what I can    Like a Louisiana man
  Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

  If you’re young or old   Exercise your soul
  Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight
  Life is so complete    It’s a tour de feet

  Oh, I remember that song
  Uh huh, Oh yeah
  Yes, I remember that song
  Uh huh, Oh yeah
   
  The one about teenage heartache
  Wishing on the stars above
  A song about staying out too late
  Thinking you're in trouble and knowing you're in love
   
  The way that they sang together
  Strumming those twin guitars
  I thought that it would last forever
  I saw them on the TV, I heard them in my car
   
  Why oh why did you leave me?
  Why oh why did you go?
   
  I never will forget their voices
  Crying like two lovesick birds
  Growing up and making choices
  The magic of the music - the wisdom of the words

  I asked a friend, How do you do it
  Livin’ day to day, Don’t you get those blues
  You got no job and you got no savings
  Just an old guitar, and even older shoes
  You know what he said?
   
  I’d rather dance into the distance
  Where the tall trees cry,
  When the night winds wail
  Then to drag down streets of cold existence
  It’s a damn good walk up the old long trail
   
  Now don’t you think about the future
  Don’t your people say, It’s time to settle down
  Get yourself a wife, raise up a family
  Get outta that cloud, put your feet on the ground
   
  I still can remember, deep in December
  Locked in a little red school
  With the Snow softly falling, I could hear the calling
  Of the wild, what’s the number one rule?
   
  We talked all night, shared a bottle
  We spoke of dreams he sang some songs
  You gotta listen to your own heart, That’s what he told me
  Get your compass right and you can’t go wrong

  I’m walking the edge of a blacktop highway
  Guess nobody feels like slowing down
  Got all that I own in a beat up suitcase
  When the landlord comes I won’t be round
  I’m leaving the Lonely Side of Town

  There’s a girl back home and god, I miss her
  I’m thinkin’, It’s time to settle down
  Just one good ride and I’ll be with her
  Thumb in the air, I’m homeward bound
  I’m leaving the Lonely Side of Town

  Let the cold wind comb my hair
  Let the people point and stare
  Who cares what they’re thinking of
  I got her letter just yesterday
  Called and said, I’m on my way
  Now you’re lookin’ at a man in love

  I’m leaving those sleepless nights behind me
  I’m leaving the state of mind I’m in
  Out where the blues won’t ever find me
  Say goodbye and turn around
  I’m leaving the Lonely Side of Town

  When I was five I found my mother crying by the phone
  She said, I’ll be alright you run along
  I did what any boy would do, I turned and went outside
  And brought her every dandelion that my hands could find
  And she said, They look like orchids, so beautiful and bright
  If you hold them to the sun, and Get The Angle Right

  Diamonds are a girls’ best friend, I heard the TV say
  Show how much you care by what you pay
  I’d like to show you something that didn’t cost a dime
  A shiny stone I found when I was maybe eight or nine
  And there’s a million stars a-twinkling, like diamonds in the night
  If you hold it to the sun, and Get The Angle Right

  Yes, and I hear tell the cost of love is high
  But I’m glad to know it’s something you can’t buy

  I know that life’s not perfect, there are no guarantees
  But every day’s a good day, you’re with me
  I’d like to bring you orchids, yes and diamonds too
  I guess these dandelions and a shiny stone will do
  Our love will last forever and every moment is bright
  If we hold them to the sun, and Get The Angle Right

  Dust Bowl Joe, No he won’t go, He’s the one that stuck around
  Some forgot, most they don’t know, He’s the man that stood his ground
  When the dust storms hit, most folks quit
  They couldn’t stand that lonesome sound
  But Dust Bowl Joe pulled his hat low, Set his teeth and hunkered down
  He’s a hero in this town

  GI Joe movin’ kinda slow, limping back from World War Two
  Scars he’s got, Lord they don’t show, all the hell that he went through
  When the first shell hit, the shrapnel bit and nearly tore his leg in two
  But GI Joe shifted into low, drove his men to higher ground
  He’s a hero in this town

  “Whiskey Joe hang your head low”, walk the dark side of life
  Step by step, blow by blow, lost a child and his wife
  In the face of it, he almost quit, tried to drink this county dry
  But Whiskey Joe looked into his soul, Stood to fight another round
  He’s a hero in this town

  Grandpa Joe what a way to go, We’re burying a real class act
  A one line will for a Coupe De Ville, “Plant me in my Cadillac”
  ‘Cause all that shit, that life will git, rolls off a good man's back
  Grandpa Joe, ease him down slow, Here’s a man that’s glory bound
  He’s a hero in this town

  When I smell flowers, it takes away a winters care
  A little wild-flower said she had to go back north somewhere
  Don’t you know I’m coming back someday

  Lord, there’s a bluebird on the wing
  When I see a bluebird I think it’s ‘bout time for spring
  Hey mister bluebird if you see that girl won’t you sing
  Don’t you know he’s coming back someday

  Lord, I got cornsilk in my hands
  When I feel cornsilk I think about summer sand
  Hair soft as cornsilk, guess it didn’t go the way I planned
  Don’t you know I’m coming back someday

  When I’m feeling empty, just a little down and weak 
  I know where I am welcome day or night
  I walk up to the corner, take my favorite seat
  By the second cup of coffee, I will be alright

  Doris takes my order and I always get the same
  A couple over easy and home fries
  She forgets the orange juice but I don’t complain
  If I do as well at her age,  Lord I’ll be doing fine

  At the corner, going back in time
  At the corner, stuck in 1949
  Well some folks think it’s strange
  That nothing here has changed
  But me, I love the corner just the same
  Where the world is plain
  Before we went insane

  Well it looks like Norman Rockwell was in here yesterday
  Wonder if he had the apple pie
  Don’t suppose it’s homemade, looks good anyway
  I’ll take a scoop of ice cream on the side

  The radio is playing a song from way back when
  Doris, she remembers every line
  I know that it sounds crazy, but when she turns her head
  To me she looks a bit like Patsy Cline

  I saw your face just today
  The hometown girl on the front page
  There you were In mid air
  Friday you’d be center stage

  But you’re an apparition, I’m stuck in first position
  The dancer and the boy are worlds apart
  Why should I be upset, I can do a two step
  Give me half a dance to win your heart

  Now I don’t need that old TV
  I’ve got better things to do
  I broke my bank and bought a front row seat
  Friday I’ll be watching you

  Now the curtain falls
  It’s the final bow 
  That’s when suddenly you see
  The boy next door with roses in hand
  “Please come dance tonight with me”

  Well, Back  in the day baby back in this swamp
  A bad boy, cowboy drifting right along
  Lost in the Bayou, Lost in the the blues
  Shovel headed, dead-a-headed, breaker of the rules
  He pulled in a roadhouse, it was the Devil’s Dream
  And Oh, Dennis Hopper met the Cajun Queen

  A oh, When you throw them dice
  A oh, in the Voodoo rice
  A oh, Gonna lose your soul
  A oh, to Jolie Laveau
  jeter les dés dans le riz vaudou
    égarer l'âme Jolie Laveau

  The sweet shady marmalady looked in his eyes
  Her chocolate legs make him beg to do the slip and slide
  Crazy go the Zydeco a pumping loud and clear
  A cocain line, a neon sign a-flashing Ice cold beer
  Her age didn’t it matter, Her name was it Jolie 
  Oh, Dennis Hopper bet the Cajun Queen

  Trouble and darkness it rode by his side
  Sold his soul to Jolie for that Easy Ride
  He drank up the whisky and cranked up the stakes
  Dropped a lot of acid by the Saint Louis gates
  Everybody loved him, He made a lot of green
  Oh, Dennis Hopper, et le Cajun Reine

  Here’s to the Rocky Road, The ups and downs
  Traveling a better road Through the fields and towns
  High on a mountainside Or in the valley below
  You’re gonna find a sweeter ride Along the Rocky Road

  Lace up your old boots, leave the key on the hook
  Sometimes second chances don’t need a second look
  Old regrets and memories are bills you just can’t pay
  Now someone else can fix that Chevrolet

  Follow the music, it’s like drifting in a dream
  Wash away your troubles in that flowing stream
  Sing with true heart, leave it right out on your sleeve
  Rid yourself of all that you don’t need

  When the path of least resistance
  Gets filled up with foolish pride
  Take the road to self fulfilment
  It’s right outside, yea it’s right outside

  When the last light is fading, and the day is done
  The cold hand of winter will hide the warming sun
  All good intentions will pave a golden road
  It’s not the path you chose so long ago

  When I was a boy I'd scratch like the Dickens
  Scratch like the Dickens, scratch like the Dickens
  When I was a boy I'd scratch like the Dickens
  Got my fleas from a dog

  One for seven, so they say
  Dogs grow old, while the children play
  Teacher, teacher long ago
  I learned all I need to know from a dog

  Now my knees they knock through the woods
  Clock through the woods, Tick Tock through the woods
  Now my knees they knock through the woods
  Knockin’ with a little white dog

  Hey up girl let's go to the shelter
  Down to the shelter, off to the shelter

  In those hills of Carolina
  Tween the Piney and the Blue
  Dreams of cities, they will blind you
  Should the neon get to you

  Chopping wood to make a dollar
  Play the radio at night
  Mailing off to big Chicago
  A Stella guitar can change your life

  Gold will glitter in the city                      
  But Broadway lights don’t shine for me          
  I keep coming back to my home in ol’ Deep Gap
  Carolina’s all I really need

  Record man he says you’re something
  Come to New York in the spring
  All these folks here in the city
  Will love to hear you pick and sing

  Be it center stage at Newport
  Or with presidents and Kings
  I’m still longing for my back porch
  And the happiness it brings

  Tune in  my favorite TV shows

  There’s No Cowboys in My Life Anymore

  The pony’s twenty two years old
  He doesn’t know that he’s been sold
  Giving rides to kids the best part of his life
  And another tradition dies

  Ride a little pony, go round the ring again
  Look at all the happy faces on the children
  Ride a little pony, such a gentle stride
  Daddy takes a picture, Mommy’s standing by your side
  For The Last Pony Ride

  A pony doesn’t pay today
  He barely earns the feed and hay
  The pasture and the barn, that’s all he’s ever known
  But tomorrow they’ll be gone

  And as this day comes to an end
  A trailer waits beside the fence
  Wherever he may go, wherever he may be
  I hope there’s children and an apple tree

  A long time ago back in old Idaho
  Me and my dog running free
  And most every day you could find us at play
  In the stream at the end of my street

  Everyone needs a cool running stream
  To carry their troubles away
  It’s a long hard road but I’m cooling my feet
  In the stream at the end of my street

  Fishing for hours, picking wild flowers
  Swing from a rope on a tree
  Just a half a block from home and I’d be skipping stones
  In the stream at the end of my street

  Now that I’m grown, got a child of my own
  I’m hoping that he’ll take after me
  Cross a continent I came, but some things never change
  There’s a stream at the end of my street

  And I’m staring through a dirty Greyhound window
  Dusty rain begins to fall and we head out for St. Paul
  Paulina, Tell my why you still haunt my memory
  Is you or just the highway calling me

  Every time I close my eyes some baby starts to cry
  Mamasita sings a Spanish lullaby
  Smoke is drifting up the aisle, the kind that makes me smile
  Paulina, Paulina will I ever understand this mystery
  Is you or just the highway calling me

  ‘Ore the hills of Oklahoma, across the Kansas plains
  Will you listen to the wind and me
  We’re whispering your name
  Paulina

  Now the weather’s getting colder
  So darling I won’t blame you
  If you tell the operator, “No I won’t accept the call”
  A hundred miles left to go and the driver’s talking snow
  Paulina, Paulina how I wish the road ahead was clear to see
  Is you or just the highway calling me

  Paulina, Paulina

  You can’t tell a person

  What I have or what I don’t

  I got a pocketful of memories
  A pocketful of dust
  A pocket full of things you’ll never see
  And though it’s been a long time
  Since they were lined with green
  I got pockets full of everything I need
  I got pockets full of everything I need

  I’d trade in a paycheck
  For an old guitar pick
  With a new song in my pocket
  Don’t I feel like I’m rich

  When my days are over
  Tune my guitar up for me
  Put pen and paper in my pocket
  Then I’ll lay me down to sleep

  You always feel cleaner after the rain
  You gonna feel stronger after the pain
  You might be defeated but don’t say goodbye
  Tell her you love her, you need her
  Breakdown and cry

  The sorrow you’re feeling doesn’t show on your face
  You’ve learned how to push it into a cold dark place
  You’re keeping it bottled up tight like they told you, you should
  If you don’t let it out, it’ll do you more damage than good

  I’ve learned my lesson, Life can be lonely and long
  The man who hides what he feels, he’s not so strong

  When I was a boy of ten I did something wrong
  I went through the closet and I found my father’s gun
  My sister caught me playing, She said, “I’m gonna tell”
  So I ran away from home, I knew that I’d catch hell

  The world was awful big and so I didn’t go too far
  I hid out in the treehouse right in my own backyard
  When Daddy slammed the screen door, fear shot through my heart
  I couldn’t keep from crying as I shivered in the dark

  /well now you ain’t seen nothin’ till you seen my Dad
  He has this trick of growin’ ten feet when he’s mad
  I swear his eyes shoot fire and smoke pours from his ears
  But as he started talking he wiped away my tears

  Son, if you’ve got a problem I’m always here for you
  You’ll feel a whole lot better if you talk it through
  ‘Cause I’ve got time to listen, I’ll never lock that door
  And all can be forgiven, Hey what’s a father for?

  I’m driving late, way out of state
  Down some lonesome road
  Over the tires, scratch on the wire
  Twin fiddles are playing low

  I like the sound of a sweet country waltz
  Played on the radio
  I like the sound of a sweet country waltz
  Yodel la de oh

  My hand shoots out, no room for doubt
  Turn her up far as she goes
  Nothing’s so sweet as a three quarter beat
  I’m singing all the way home

  Fast rolling trains and high flying planes
  They get you there fast as they can
  But I’ll take the dust, the back roads and rust
  Play me the slow one again

  Sara says, “Can I help you?”
  John says, “I don’t know, but you can try.
  What do you do when you get lonesome?”
  Sara gets that twinkle in her eye.

  Give me a good old country song
  Where the heartache really comes on strong
  But the lovin’ just won’t go away
  Give me a good old country song
  The right one can last so long
  I need to hear that song today

  John drops two quarters in the Juke Box
  Sara says, “Play B-24”
  He smiles as his fingers punch the buttons
  It’s just like a thousand times before

  Sara turns the lights out in the diner
  John tips his hat and holds her coat
  She slips her arm around her husband
  Sara and John are headed home
